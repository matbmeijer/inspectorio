The **Inspectorio API Wrapper** is an unofficial Python library designed to simplify interactions with the [Inspectorio API](https://developers.inspectorio.com). It provides an asynchronous interface to access Inspectorio's platform, offering features that streamline the process of integrating Inspectorio's capabilities into your Python applications.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Requests:** Leverage Python's async/await syntax to perform non-blocking API calls, enabling faster data retrieval and improved efficiency in I/O bound applications.
- **Automatic Pagination Handling:** Effortlessly manage API pagination with built-in methods to fetch all relevant data without manually handling page tokens or limits.
- **Swagger Documentation Support:** Directly based on [Inspectorio's Swagger documentation](https://sight.inspectorio.com/swagger/), ensuring comprehensive coverage of API endpoints and parameters.
- **Secure Authentication:** Simplified and secure handling of authentication tokens, abstracting the complexity of token management and headers.
- **Error Handling:** Provides structured error handling mechanisms, making it easier to debug issues related to API requests.
